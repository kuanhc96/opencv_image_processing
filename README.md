# opencv_image_processing

This repository consists of files used for practicing basic openCV operations, including:
1. morphological operations
2. blurring
3. color spaces
4. thresholding for foreground and background separation
5. adaptive thresholding (local thresholding)
6. convolutions (kernel operations)
7. gradients for edge detection (Sobel and Scharr methods)
8. Canny edge detection (manual and auto hysteresis)
